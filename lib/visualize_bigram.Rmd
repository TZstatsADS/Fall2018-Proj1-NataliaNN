```{r}
#visualize_bigrams is a function which uses newtwork graph to visualize bigrams.
#Argument includes:
#arrow: Produces a description of what arrows to add to a line
#type: Indicating whether the arrow head should be a closed triangle.
#length: A unit specifying the length of the arrow head (from tip to base).
#graph_from_data_frame(): This function creates an igraph graph from one or two data frames containing the (symbolic) edge list and edge/vertex attributes.
#geom_edge_link: This geom draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes.
#geom_node_point: This geom is equivalent in functionality to geom_point and allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes.
#geom_node_text: These geoms are equivalent in functionality to geom_text and geom_label and allows for simple annotation of nodes.
#theme_void: These are complete themes which control all non-data display.
